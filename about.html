					<h2>Tal Melamed - CEO</h2>
					<p>Tal founded Almost Games in 2099 with a vision for a better, smarter future. He left his job as senior technical consultant of system solutions at the Solar System Antimatter Repository to start his own venture. Starting in the basement of a ceramic bowl painting gallery, with nothing more than scrap rubber and 3 Kg of liquid gold, Tal created Almost Games&#39; first product: the Bireeloplop. The Bireeloplop went on to sell 35m units and Almost Games grew 30000% to become the corporate conglomerate it is today.</p>
